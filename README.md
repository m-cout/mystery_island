# Mystery Island

Welcome to the Mystery Islandâ„¢ text adventure game!
Move across the exotic scenarios and interact with them by typing your actions: always a VERB followed by a NOUN.
Examples: 'Go North', 'Go South' or 'Climb Mountain'.
Good luck with your exploration! And be careful...

Part of my Python learning process.
